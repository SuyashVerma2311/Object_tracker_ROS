# Object Tracker Package for ROS
  - This Package has a oject tracker program for ROS.
  - For now it puts out the first frame of the video and tracks it for the rest of the video.
  - Although, it can be used as a wrapper to track an object if you pass the coordinates separately.
  - Sometimes, object detection for every frame is very resource heavy and slow.
  - But with this, you can detect it once and then track it for the rest of its existence of the video.
